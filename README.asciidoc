== Policy-Based Routing in Linux ==

These examples use advanced routing techniques
to solve real-world routing challenges in Linux.
Each scenario is in a separate directory with a README.

RHEL supports `rule-$dev` files in 
`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`, but these examples
use `/sbin/ifup-local` to do various loops.
